# 🔧 LLD Design Principles - Good vs Bad Code Examples

Welcome to the **Ultimate Low-Level Design (LLD) Principles Repository**!  

This repository contains **clear, side-by-side code examples** demonstrating both good and bad implementations of major LLD principles. It's an ideal resource for developers preparing for **system design interviews**, improving **code quality**, or learning to write **clean, maintainable, and extensible code**.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each LLD principle is organized in a separate folder with two subfolders:

```/[Principle_Name]/  
├── `good_code/` ✅ Correct, best-practice implementation  
└── `bad_code/` ❌ Anti-patterns and common mistakes
```
---

## 📚 Covered Design Principles

We will cover all key **object-oriented design principles** used in Low-Level Design:

- ✅ SRP - Single Responsibility Principle  
- ✅ OCP - Open/Closed Principle  
- ✅ LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle  
- ✅ ISP - Interface Segregation Principle  
- ✅ DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle  
- ✅ DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself  
- ✅ YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It  
- ✅ KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid  
- ✅ Composition over Inheritance  
- ✅ Encapsulation & Abstraction

More principles and real-world examples will be added regularly.
